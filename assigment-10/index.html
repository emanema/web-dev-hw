<p>Codes of ethics of the Public Relations Society of America, the Canadian Public Relations
Society, the International Association of Business Communicators and other professional
organizations commit public relations writers to honesty and integrity, refraining from
misleading information and correcting inaccuracies and misunderstandings.
The car dealership noted above sells “experienced vehicles,” the local thrift shop
advertises “pre-worn jeans,” and a carpet store has “semi-antique rugs.” Interesting use
of language and nobody gets hurt, so why fuss? Because sometimes people do get hurt.
When pretentious language crosses the line, it loses its innocence and becomes dishonest.
For example, when a marketer advertises rhinestones as “genuine artificial diamonds,”
who gets hurt? Perhaps the new immigrant unfamiliar with the wiles of the marketplace.
Maybe it’s just the 10-year-old looking for a present for Mother’s Day, who ends up
disappointed because he spent his paper-route money on junk.
The term doublespeak refers to language that intentionally obscures the real meaning
behind the words. The use of doublespeak raises serious ethical questions for writers. It’s
a serious matter of misleading the public when the military reports the killing of civilian
men, women and children as “collateral damage,” a term deliberately chosen to obscure
reality and minimize opposition. The Army used the term frequently during the Vietnam
War, with little public disapproval. But there was an outcry over that same military term
when American terrorist Timothy McVeigh used it in reference to the children and
adults killed when he bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The misleading
phrase made its rounds again in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon, but by then audiences
had begun to understand it to mean civilian casualties. The phrase doesn’t mask reality
as much as it once did.
The euphemism “friendly fire” masks the seriousness of the term, which refers to
accidental military firing on one’s own forces while attempting to attack the enemy. The
term has lost some of its hiding power following recent high-profile deaths. Notable
among these was the 2004 shooting of Pat Tillman, who turned down a $3.6 million NFL
football contract to join the Army Rangers eight months after the 9/11 attacks. The Army
initially claimed he was killed in Afghanistan by enemy forces, but an investigation
ordered by the Pentagon and Congress determined three years later that he had been
shot by other U.S. troops.
