# Assignment-02
## Emma Dorman

I needed to take this class in order to finish my minor in Media Arts. However, I am also very interested in web design so I am excited about this class! I love using social media and graphic design so hopefully this class will be helpful towards my career.

Things I hope to learn

1. The technical side of building a website
2. How to make a website beautiful
3. How to properly code
