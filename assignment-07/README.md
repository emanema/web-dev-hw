1. Classes add styling to divs, and can contain multiple values within them, unlike the id attribute which should contain only 1. Divs divide your page into sections.
The span element is the inline equivalent of the div element, adds inline styling to structural elements, usually for a shorter amount of info and you can have multiple span elements inside a div.
2. Alt text describes the appearance and function of an image on a page. It is critical for people that are visually impaired.
3. I had 3 midterms due March 1st and another due the 3rd so that is why this is late. Also I couldn't get the video poster to stay but if you scroll to the video and then refresh it shows for half a second?
