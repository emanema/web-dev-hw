<p>
  Everyone has that one shirt that they
  <b>Love</b> but it's just too big! Don't
  worry it's easier than you think!
  <ol>
    <li> Put on the desired t-shirt and mark
      how short you want it to be with pencil/chalk.
    </li>
    <li> Lay the t-shirt on a flat surface. Take a ruler
      and measure a straight line all the way across the shirt.
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>First: cut down the side of the shirt along the seams. <br>
         Second: flip the shirt with the back side up, and only cut the
         back along the line you drew.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fold the front side into a triangle with
      the seams lines up.
    </li>
    <li> Cut between the seems so that it cuts the
      front in half.
    </li>
    <li> Now tie the front into a cute bow or knot
      and you have a croptop! 
    </li>
  </ol>
